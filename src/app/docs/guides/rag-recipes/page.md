# Context-Engineering

This guide covers advanced techniques for rag recipes in context engineering.

## Overview

1. Basic RAG pipeline construction
2. Context window management and chunking strategies 
3. Embedding and retrieval techniques
4. Measuring retrieval quality and relevance
5. Context integration patterns
6. Advanced RAG variations

Usage:
# In Jupyter or Colab:
%run 04_rag_recipes.py

## Implementation

The complete implementation can be found in the source file: `04_rag_recipes.py`

```python
import numpy as np
import logging
import tiktoken
from typing import Dict, List, Tuple, Any, Optional, Union, Callable, TypeVar
from dataclasses import dataclass
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from IPython.display import display, Markdown, HTML

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Check for required libraries
try:
    from openai import OpenAI
    OPENAI_AVAILABLE = True
except ImportError:
```

## Key Concepts
