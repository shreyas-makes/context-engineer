# Guides

Practical guides and tutorials for implementing context engineering techniques. These guides provide hands-on experience with the concepts covered in the foundations.

## Available Guides

### 1. [Minimal Prompt](/docs/guides/minimal-prompt)
Fundamentals of context engineering through minimal, atomic prompts. Learn to construct prompts for maximum clarity and control while measuring their effectiveness.

### 2. [Expand Context](/docs/guides/expand-context)
Techniques for expanding and structuring context windows to improve LLM performance while managing token budgets effectively.

### 3. [Control Loops](/docs/guides/control-loops)
Implementation of control flow patterns in prompt engineering, including conditional logic and iterative processes.

### 4. [RAG Recipes](/docs/guides/rag-recipes)
Practical recipes for implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems with context engineering principles.

### 5. [Prompt Programs](/docs/guides/prompt-programs)
Advanced techniques for treating prompts as programs, with structured logic and algorithmic thinking.

### 6. [Schema Design](/docs/guides/schema-design)
Design patterns for creating structured schemas that guide LLM behavior and output formatting.

### 7. [Recursive Patterns](/docs/guides/recursive-patterns)
Advanced recursive patterns and self-referential structures in context engineering.

## Learning Path

For newcomers to context engineering:

1. Start with **Minimal Prompt** to understand the fundamentals
2. Progress to **Expand Context** to learn context management
3. Explore **Control Loops** for flow control patterns
4. Try **RAG Recipes** for practical applications
5. Advance to **Prompt Programs** for structured approaches
6. Study **Schema Design** for output control
7. Master **Recursive Patterns** for advanced techniques

Each guide includes:
- Theoretical background
- Practical examples
- Code implementations
- Exercises and experiments
- Integration patterns

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of LLMs and prompt engineering
- Familiarity with Python programming
- Access to an LLM API (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

## Getting Started

Each guide is self-contained and can be used independently. However, we recommend following the suggested learning path for the most comprehensive understanding of context engineering principles.
