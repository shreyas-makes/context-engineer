# Context-Engineering

This guide covers advanced techniques for schema design in context engineering.

## Overview

1. Basic schema patterns and structures
2. Schema validation and enforcement
3. Recursive and fractal schemas
4. Field protocols as schema-driven contexts
5. Measuring schema effectiveness

Usage:
# In Jupyter or Colab:
%run 06_schema_design.py
# or

## Implementation

The complete implementation can be found in the source file: `06_schema_design.py`

```python
import logging
import hashlib
import tiktoken
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from dataclasses import dataclass, field, asdict
from typing import Dict, List, Tuple, Any, Optional, Union, Callable, TypeVar, Set
from IPython.display import display, Markdown, HTML, JSON

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Check for required libraries
try:
    from openai import OpenAI
    OPENAI_AVAILABLE = True
```

## Key Concepts

This guide explores:
- Practical implementation patterns
- Code examples and templates  
- Best practices and optimization techniques
- Integration with other context engineering approaches

## Usage

To use this guide:

1. Review the theoretical concepts
2. Examine the code implementation
3. Run the examples in your environment
4. Adapt the patterns to your use case
