# Context-Engineering

This guide covers advanced techniques for recursive patterns in context engineering.

## Overview

1. Basic recursive patterns (self-reflection, bootstrapping)
2. Field protocols and shells as recursive frameworks
3. Symbolic residue and state tracking
4. Boundary collapse and gradient systems
5. Emergent attractors and resonance

Usage:
# In Jupyter or Colab:
%run 07_recursive_patterns.py
# or

## Implementation

The complete implementation can be found in the source file: `07_recursive_patterns.py`

```python
import hashlib
import logging
import tiktoken
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from dataclasses import dataclass, field, asdict
from typing import Dict, List, Tuple, Any, Optional, Union, Callable, TypeVar, Set
from IPython.display import display, Markdown, HTML, JSON

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Check for required libraries
try:
    from openai import OpenAI
    OPENAI_AVAILABLE = True
```

## Key Concepts

This guide explores:
- Practical implementation patterns
- Code examples and templates  
- Best practices and optimization techniques
- Integration with other context engineering approaches

## Usage

To use this guide:

1. Review the theoretical concepts
2. Examine the code implementation
3. Run the examples in your environment
4. Adapt the patterns to your use case
