# Context Expansion Techniques

This guide covers advanced techniques for expand context in context engineering.

## Overview

1. Transforming minimal prompts into expanded, context-rich structures
2. Principles of context layering and compositional prompt engineering
3. Quantitative measurement of token usage as context grows
4. Qualitative assessment of model output improvements
5. Iterative approaches to context refinement and optimization

Usage:
# In Jupyter or Colab:
%run 02_context_expansion.py
# or

## Implementation

The complete implementation can be found in the source file: `02_expand_context.py`

```python


```python
import os
import json
import time
import tiktoken  # OpenAI's tokenizer
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from typing import Dict, List, Tuple, Any, Optional, Union

# Load environment variables (you'll need to add your API key in a .env file)
# For OpenAI API key
import dotenv
dotenv.load_dotenv()

# Define API clients (choose one based on your preference)
USE_OPENAI = True  # Set to False to use another provider

if USE_OPENAI:
```

## Key Concepts

This guide explores:
- Practical implementation patterns
- Code examples and templates

- Integration with other context engineering approaches

## Usage

To use this guide:

1. Review the theoretical concepts
2. Examine the code implementation
3. Run the examples in your environment
4. Adapt the patterns to your use case
