# Minimal Prompt Exploration

This guide covers advanced techniques for min prompt in context engineering.

## Overview

1. Constructing atomic prompts for maximum clarity and control
2. Measuring effectiveness through token count and model response quality
3. Iterative prompt modification for rapid feedback cycles
4. Observing context drift and minimal prompt boundaries
5. Foundations for scaling from atomic prompts to protocolized shells

Usage:
# In Jupyter or Colab:
%run 01_min_prompt.py
# or

## Implementation

The complete implementation can be found in the source file: `01_min_prompt.py`

```python
import time
import json
from typing import Dict, List, Any, Tuple, Optional
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# If you're using OpenAI's API, uncomment these lines and add your API key
# import openai
# openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")  # Set your API key as an environment variable

# If you're using another provider, adjust accordingly
# Dummy LLM class for demonstration purposes
class SimpleLLM:
    """Minimal LLM interface for demonstration."""
    
    def __init__(self, model_name: str = "dummy-model"):
        """Initialize LLM interface."""
        self.model_name = model_name
        self.total_tokens_used = 0
        self.total_requests = 0
        
```
