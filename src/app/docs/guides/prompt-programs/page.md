# Context-Engineering

This guide covers advanced techniques for prompt programs in context engineering.

## Overview

1. Basic prompt program structures and templates
2. Compositional operations (reasoning steps, verification, synthesis)
3. Protocol shells and frameworks as prompt programs
4. Field protocols and frameworks for emergent reasoning
5. Advanced patterns for self-improving prompt programs

Usage:
# In Jupyter or Colab:
%run 05_prompt_programs.py
# or

## Implementation

The complete implementation can be found in the source file: `05_prompt_programs.py`

```python
import hashlib
import tiktoken
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from typing import Dict, List, Tuple, Any, Optional, Union, Callable, TypeVar
from IPython.display import display, Markdown, HTML

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Check for required libraries
try:
    from openai import OpenAI
    OPENAI_AVAILABLE = True
except ImportError:
```

## Key Concepts
