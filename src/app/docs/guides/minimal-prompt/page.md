# Minimal Prompt Exploration

Fundamentals of Context Engineering

This guide introduces the core principles of context engineering by exploring minimal, atomic prompts and their direct impact on LLM output and behavior.

## Key Concepts Covered

1. Constructing atomic prompts for maximum clarity and control
2. Measuring effectiveness through token count and model response quality
3. Iterative prompt modification for rapid feedback cycles
4. Observing context drift and minimal prompt boundaries
5. Foundations for scaling from atomic prompts to protocolized shells

## Experiment 1: The Atomic Prompt

Let's start with the most basic unit: a single instruction.

```python
atomic_prompt = "Write a short poem about programming."
```

This is prompt engineering in its purest form. The atomic prompt contains:
- **Task**: "Write a short poem"
- **Subject**: "about programming"
- **Constraints**: "short" (minimal constraint)

## Experiment 2: Adding Constraints

Now let's add constraints to our atomic prompt and observe the difference.

```python
prompts = [
    "Write a short poem about programming.",  # Original
    "Write a short poem about programming in 4 lines.",  # Added length constraint
    "Write a short haiku about programming using only simple words."  # Format and vocabulary constraints
]
```

### Results Pattern

As we add constraints, we typically observe:
- **Increased token count**: More specific instructions require more tokens
- **Improved specificity**: Output becomes more predictable
- **Higher quality**: Well-designed constraints improve relevance

## Experiment 3: Measuring the ROI Curve

The relationship between prompt complexity and output quality follows a predictable pattern:

```
Quality (1-10)
    ▲
    │     ●
    │   ●
    │ ●
    └─────────► Tokens
```

### Key Insights

1. **Initial steep improvement**: First few constraint tokens yield high returns
2. **Diminishing returns**: Additional constraints provide smaller improvements
3. **Sweet spot**: Optimal balance between token cost and quality

## Experiment 4: Minimal Context Enhancement

Strategic context addition can dramatically improve output while keeping token count low:

```python
enhanced_prompt = """Task: Write a haiku about programming.

A haiku is a three-line poem with 5, 7, and 5 syllables per line.
Focus on the feeling of solving a difficult bug."""
```

This enhancement adds:
- **Format specification**: Clear structure requirements
- **Contextual guidance**: Emotional direction
- **Educational component**: Format explanation

## Experiment 5: Measuring Consistency

Testing how consistent outputs are with minimal vs. enhanced prompts:

```python
def measure_consistency(prompt: str, n_samples: int = 3):
    """Generate multiple responses and measure consistency metrics."""
    responses = []
    for _ in range(n_samples):
        response = llm.generate(prompt)
        responses.append(response)
    
    # Calculate consistency metrics
    return calculate_similarity_scores(responses)
```

### Consistency Patterns

- **Basic prompts**: Higher variance in output
- **Enhanced prompts**: More consistent, predictable results
- **Over-constrained prompts**: May become too rigid

## Implementation Code

Here's a complete implementation for experimenting with minimal prompts:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import os
import time
import json
from typing import Dict, List, Any, Tuple, Optional
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

class SimpleLLM:
    """Minimal LLM interface for demonstration."""
    
    def __init__(self, model_name: str = "dummy-model"):
        self.model_name = model_name
        self.total_tokens_used = 0
        self.total_requests = 0
        
    def count_tokens(self, text: str) -> int:
        """Count tokens using simple approximation."""
        # Use proper tokenizer in production
        return len(text.split())
    
    def generate(self, prompt: str) -> str:
        """Generate text from prompt."""
        # In real implementation, call actual LLM API
        tokens = self.count_tokens(prompt)
        self.total_tokens_used += tokens
        self.total_requests += 1
        
        return f"[LLM response for {tokens} token prompt]"
    
    def get_stats(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Return usage statistics."""
        return {
            "total_tokens": self.total_tokens_used,
            "total_requests": self.total_requests,
            "avg_tokens_per_request": self.total_tokens_used / max(1, self.total_requests)
        }

# Usage example
llm = SimpleLLM()

# Test atomic prompt
atomic_prompt = "Write a short poem about programming."
response = llm.generate(atomic_prompt)
print(f"Response: {response}")
```

## Key Insights from Experiments

1. **Small additions matter**: Even small prompt additions can significantly impact output quality
2. **ROI curve exists**: Token count and quality find an optimal balance point
3. **Strategic context helps**: Minimal but well-chosen context improves consistency
4. **Clarity over brevity**: The best prompts are clear and provide just enough context

## Token Efficiency Guidelines

### Optimal Token Usage
- **5-15 tokens**: Basic task specification
- **15-30 tokens**: Task + format constraints
- **30-50 tokens**: Task + format + context guidance
- **50+ tokens**: Diminishing returns for simple tasks

### Efficiency Patterns
- Start with minimal viable prompt
- Add constraints incrementally
- Measure quality at each step
- Find the efficiency sweet spot

## Next Steps

1. **Connect to real LLM**: Replace dummy implementation with actual API
2. **Implement metrics**: Add proper consistency and quality measurements
3. **Test variations**: Try different model sizes and providers
4. **Find your baseline**: Establish minimum viable context for your use cases

## Advanced Experiments

### Consistency Testing
```python
def test_prompt_consistency(prompt, n_trials=5):
    responses = [llm.generate(prompt) for _ in range(n_trials)]
    # Analyze variance in responses
    return calculate_consistency_metrics(responses)
```

### Quality Scoring
```python
def score_response_quality(response, criteria):
    scores = {}
    for criterion in criteria:
        scores[criterion] = evaluate_criterion(response, criterion)
    return scores
```

### Token Optimization
```python
def find_optimal_prompt(base_prompt, constraints):
    best_prompt = base_prompt
    best_score = 0
    
    for constraint in constraints:
        test_prompt = f"{base_prompt} {constraint}"
        quality = measure_quality(test_prompt)
        tokens = count_tokens(test_prompt)
        efficiency = quality / tokens
        
        if efficiency > best_score:
            best_prompt = test_prompt
            best_score = efficiency
    
    return best_prompt, best_score
```
