# Context-Engineering

This guide covers advanced techniques for control loops in context engineering.

## Overview



## Implementation

The complete implementation can be found in the source file: `03_control_loops.py`

```python
import time
import tiktoken
from typing import Dict, List, Tuple, Any, Optional, Union, Callable, TypeVar

# Type variables for better type hinting
T = TypeVar('T')
Response = Union[str, Dict[str, Any]]

# For logging and visualization
import logging
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from IPython.display import display, Markdown, HTML

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```
