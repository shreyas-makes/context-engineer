# Cognitive Tools

Advanced cognitive frameworks and tools for sophisticated reasoning patterns and mental model implementations in context engineering.

## Overview

Cognitive tools provide structured approaches to reasoning, understanding, and problem-solving within context engineering systems. They bridge the gap between basic prompting and advanced field theory applications.

## Tool Categories

### [Cognitive Architectures](/docs/cognitive-tools/cognitive-architectures)
Fundamental cognitive frameworks and architectural patterns for building intelligent context systems.

### [Cognitive Programs](/docs/cognitive-tools/cognitive-programs)
Structured programs implementing cognitive processes and reasoning patterns.
- [Basic Programs](/docs/cognitive-tools/cognitive-programs/basic): Foundational cognitive patterns
- [Advanced Programs](/docs/cognitive-tools/cognitive-programs/advanced): Sophisticated reasoning implementations

### [Cognitive Schemas](/docs/cognitive-tools/cognitive-schemas)
Schema definitions for cognitive processes and mental model structures.

### [Cognitive Templates](/docs/cognitive-tools/cognitive-templates)
Reusable templates for common cognitive patterns and reasoning frameworks.
- [Composition](/docs/cognitive-tools/cognitive-templates/composition): Compositional reasoning patterns
- [Reasoning](/docs/cognitive-tools/cognitive-templates/reasoning): General reasoning frameworks
- [Understanding](/docs/cognitive-tools/cognitive-templates/understanding): Comprehension and interpretation tools
- [Verification](/docs/cognitive-tools/cognitive-templates/verification): Validation and checking mechanisms

## Key Features

### Mental Model Implementation
- Structured frameworks for implementing mental models
- Pattern recognition and abstraction tools
- Cognitive bias awareness and mitigation
- Multi-perspective reasoning capabilities

### Reasoning Enhancement
- Logical reasoning frameworks

## Integration with Context Engineering

Cognitive tools integrate seamlessly with:
- **[Foundations](/docs/foundations)**: Building on theoretical cognitive principles
- **[Protocols](/docs/protocols)**: Enhancing protocol implementations with cognitive patterns
- **[Templates](/docs/templates)**: Providing cognitive-enhanced templates
- **[Examples](/docs/examples)**: Demonstrating cognitive tool applications

## Usage Patterns

### Basic Implementation
```python
from cognitive_tools import CognitiveFramework

# Initialize cognitive framework
framework = CognitiveFramework()

# Apply reasoning pattern
result = framework.apply_reasoning(
    pattern="causal_analysis",
    input_data=data,
    context=context
)
```

### Advanced Composition
```python
# Compose multiple cognitive tools
cognitive_pipeline = [
    "understanding.comprehension",
    "reasoning.causal_analysis", 
    "verification.consistency_check"
]

result = framework.compose_tools(cognitive_pipeline, input_data)
```

## Applications

## Development Guidelines

### Creating Cognitive Tools
1. **Identify Cognitive Process**: Define the specific cognitive function
2. **Design Framework**: Create structured approach to the process
3. **Implement Patterns**: Develop reusable implementation patterns
4. **Validate Effectiveness**: Test across multiple domains and use cases
5. **Document Thoroughly**: Provide clear usage guidelines and examples

### Best Practices
- Ground tools in cognitive science research
- Ensure broad applicability across domains
- Design for composability with other tools
- Include bias detection and mitigation
- Provide clear performance metrics
