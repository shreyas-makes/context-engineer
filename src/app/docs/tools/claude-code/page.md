## Real Examples for Claude Code

### Example 1: Starting a New Feature

**❌ Vague Request:**
"Help me build a user authentication system"

**✅ Context-Engineered Request:**
```
I need to build a user authentication system for a React/Node.js application.

**Project Context:**
- Building a task management SaaS app
- Currently using React frontend with Express.js backend
- MongoDB for data storage, considering JWT for tokens
- Team of 3 developers, mix of junior and senior

**Current State:**
- Basic app structure is in place
- User registration form exists but not connected
- No authentication middleware yet
- Using Axios for API calls

**Requirements:**
- Email/password authentication
- Password reset functionality
- JWT token-based sessions
- Role-based access (admin, user)
- Secure password storage with bcrypt

**Constraints:**
- Must integrate with existing React Router setup
- Need to be production-ready for security
- Should follow our current API pattern (/api/v1/...)
- Budget allows for 3rd party services if needed

**Style Preferences:**
- TypeScript for type safety
- Functional components with hooks
- Clear error handling and user feedback
- Comprehensive inline documentation

**Next Steps:**
- Implement backend authentication routes first
- Add frontend login/register components
- Test with Postman before frontend integration
- Deploy to staging for security testing
```

### Example 2: Debugging Performance Issues

**❌ Vague Request:**
"My app is slow, can you help?"

**✅ Context-Engineered Request:**
```
I'm experiencing performance issues in my React application and need help identifying and fixing bottlenecks.

**Project Context:**
- E-commerce React app with 50+ components
- Using Redux for state management
- Backend API built with Node.js/Express
- Deployed on Vercel with Postgres database

**Current Performance Issues:**
- Initial page load takes 4-6 seconds
- Product listing page becomes sluggish with 100+ items
- Search functionality has 2-3 second delays
- Mobile performance is significantly worse

**What I've Tried:**
- Basic React DevTools profiling
- Checked network tab for slow API calls
- Added React.memo to some components
- Enabled production build optimizations

**Technical Details:**
- Bundle size is currently 1.2MB
- Using Create React App (not ejected)
- API responses average 200-500ms
- No current caching strategy

**Goals:**
- Reduce initial load time to under 2 seconds
- Smooth scrolling on product listings
- Instant search results (< 500ms)
- Better mobile performance

**Analysis Needed:**
1. Bundle size optimization opportunities
2. Component re-render identification
3. API call optimization strategies
4. Caching implementation recommendations
5. Code splitting opportunities

Please help me systematically identify and address these performance bottlenecks.
```

### Example 3: Code Refactoring

**❌ Vague Request:**
"Clean up this messy code"

**✅ Context-Engineered Request:**
```
I need help refactoring a React component that has grown complex and difficult to maintain.

**Component Context:**
- UserProfile component handling user data display and editing
- Currently 300+ lines with mixed concerns
- Handles API calls, form validation, and UI rendering
- Used in 3 different parts of the app with slight variations

**Current Issues:**
- Difficult to test due to mixed concerns
- Props drilling through multiple levels
- Inconsistent error handling
- Duplicate validation logic
- Hard to understand control flow

**Existing Code Patterns:**
- Using TypeScript with strict mode
- Custom hooks for API calls (useApi pattern)
- Styled-components for styling
- React Hook Form for form management
- Context for theme and auth state

**Refactoring Goals:**
- Separate concerns into logical components
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Improve testability with better separation
- Maintain existing functionality exactly
- Follow existing project patterns

**Constraints:**
- Cannot change external API contracts
- Must maintain TypeScript strict compliance
- Should not break existing tests
- Keep bundle size impact minimal

**Preferred Approach:**
1. Break down into smaller, focused components
2. Extract business logic into custom hooks
3. Create reusable validation schemas
4. Improve error boundary implementation
5. Add comprehensive unit tests

Please help me create a clean, maintainable architecture while preserving all current functionality.
