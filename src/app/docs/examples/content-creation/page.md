## Tips for Better Content Requests

### 1. Always Include Your Audience
Don't just say "write for social media" - specify who you're trying to reach:
- Demographics (age, location, income)
- Psychographics (interests, values, pain points)
- Relationship to your business (new customer, loyal fan, prospect)

### 2. Be Specific About Tone
Instead of "professional," try:
- "Professional but approachable, like a knowledgeable colleague"
- "Warm and friendly, like talking to a trusted friend"
- "Confident and authoritative, like an expert in the field"

### 3. Set Clear Constraints
- Length limits (characters for social media, words for articles)
- Format requirements (bullet points, numbered lists, paragraphs)
- What to avoid (jargon, certain phrases, competitors' approaches)

### 4. Provide Context About Your Business
- What you do (in simple terms)
- Who you serve
- What makes you different
- Your current challenges or goals

### 5. Show Examples When Possible
Include examples of content you love, even if it's from competitors or different industries. This helps AI understand your style preferences.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Being Too Generic
"Write content for my business" → AI can't guess your specific needs

### ❌ Forgetting Your Audience
"Write a blog post about productivity" → Who is this for? What's their situation?

### ❌ No Clear Purpose
"Write an email" → What should happen after they read it?

### ❌ Ignoring Your Brand Voice
"Write like other successful companies" → Your voice is what makes you unique

## Next Steps

Ready to create better content? Try these:

1. **Start with one request** using the formula above
2. **Compare the results** to what you usually get
3. **Refine your approach** based on what works
4. **Build a library** of your best prompt templates
5. **Share with your team** so everyone gets consistent results

Remember: The goal isn't to be perfect from day one. It's to be more intentional about how you communicate your needs to AI tools.
