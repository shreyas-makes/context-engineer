## Usage Patterns

### Quick Start
```python
# Import the example implementation
from examples.toy_chatbot import ToyContextChatbot

# Initialize with default configuration
chatbot = ToyContextChatbot()

# Basic interaction
response = chatbot.chat("Hello, how are you?")
print(response)

# Show internal state
chatbot.show_field_state()
```

### Advanced Usage
```python
# Custom protocol configuration
protocols = [
    '/attractor.co.emerge',
    '/field.resonance.scaffold',
    '/recursive.memory.attractor'
]

chatbot = ToyContextChatbot(protocols=protocols)

# Demonstrate meta-recursive improvement
chatbot.meta_improve()

# Analyze field coherence
coherence_metrics = chatbot.measure_field_coherence()
```
