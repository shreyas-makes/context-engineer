# Toy Chatbot: Complete Context Engineering Example

A minimal implementation demonstrating context engineering principles from atoms to meta-recursive operations.

## Overview

This toy chatbot showcases the progression through context engineering layers:
- **Atoms**: Basic prompts and responses
- **Molecules**: Context combinations and examples  
- **Cells**: Memory and state management
- **Organs**: Coordinated system behaviors
- **Fields**: Continuous semantic operations
- **Meta-Recursive**: Self-improvement capabilities

## Architecture

```
Context Field Architecture:
├── Core Layer: Basic conversation handling
├── Protocol Layer: Field operations and resonance
├── Memory Layer: Persistent attractor dynamics
├── Meta Layer: Self-reflection and improvement
└── Integration: Unified field orchestration
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Atomic Foundation
- Basic prompt-response patterns
- Simple conversation flow
- Token efficiency optimization

### Phase 2: Field Integration
- Protocol shell implementations
- Context field management
- Attractor dynamics
- Resonance measurement

### Phase 3: Meta-Recursive Enhancement
- Self-monitoring capabilities
- Protocol adaptation
- Emergent behavior detection
- Dynamic reconfiguration

## Protocol Shells Used

The implementation leverages several protocol shells:

- **`/attractor.co.emerge`**: Context pattern detection and surfacing
- **`/field.resonance.scaffold`**: Conversation coherence maintenance  
- **`/recursive.memory.attractor`**: Memory persistence across sessions
- **`/field.self_repair`**: Error recovery and adaptation

## Core Components

### 1. Chatbot Core (`chatbot_core.py.md`)
The main implementation featuring:
- Field operation integration
- Context management
- Protocol orchestration
- Response generation

### 2. Protocol Shells (`protocol_shells.py.md`)
Protocol shell implementations:
- Attractor emergence protocols
- Field resonance scaffolding
- Memory persistence patterns
- Self-repair mechanisms

### 3. Context Field (`context_field.py.md`)
Context field management:
- Semantic field representation
- Field state tracking
- Coherence measurement
- Dynamic reconfiguration

### 4. Conversation Examples (`conversation_examples.py.md`)
Demonstration conversations showing:
- Progression through complexity levels
- Protocol activation patterns
- Field state evolution
- Emergent behaviors

### 5. Meta-Recursive Demo (`meta_recursive_demo.py.md`)
Self-improvement demonstration:

## Usage Examples

### Basic Interaction

```python
from chatbot_core import ToyContextChatbot

# Initialize with field protocols
chatbot = ToyContextChatbot()

# Basic conversation
response = chatbot.chat("Hello, how are you?")
print(response)

# Show field state
chatbot.show_field_state()
```

### Advanced Field Operations

```python
# Configure specific protocols
protocols = [
    '/attractor.co.emerge',
    '/field.resonance.scaffold',
    '/recursive.memory.attractor'
]

chatbot = ToyContextChatbot(protocols=protocols)

# Demonstrate field resonance
chatbot.measure_field_resonance()

# Show attractor dynamics
chatbot.show_attractor_state()
```

### Meta-Recursive Enhancement

```python
# Enable meta-recursive capabilities
chatbot.enable_meta_recursive_mode()

# Demonstrate self-improvement
