## Overview

The foundations directory contains the core theoretical foundations of context engineering, progressing from basic prompting concepts to advanced unified field theory. Each module builds on the previous ones, creating a comprehensive framework for understanding and manipulating context in large language models.

## Biological Metaphor

Our approach is structured around a biological metaphor that provides an intuitive framework for understanding the increasing complexity of context engineering:

| Level | Metaphor | Context Engineering Concept |
|-------|----------|------------------------------|
| 1 | **Atoms** | Basic instructions and prompts |
| 2 | **Molecules** | Few-shot examples and demonstrations |
| 3 | **Cells** | Stateful memory and conversation |
| 4 | **Organs** | Multi-step applications and workflows |
| 5 | **Neural Systems** | Cognitive tools and mental models |
| 6 | **Neural Fields** | Continuous semantic landscapes |

As we progress through these levels, we move from discrete, static approaches to more continuous, dynamic, and emergent systems.

## Theoretical Perspectives

Our foundation modules approach context engineering from three complementary perspectives:

### Field Perspective
Views context as a continuous semantic landscape with:
- **Attractors**: Stable semantic configurations
- **Resonance**: Reinforcement between patterns
- **Persistence**: Durability of structures over time
- **Boundaries**: Interfaces between semantic regions

### Symbolic Perspective
Reveals how LLMs implement symbol processing through:
- **Symbol Abstraction**: Converting tokens to abstract variables
- **Symbolic Induction**: Recognizing patterns over variables
- **Retrieval**: Mapping variables back to concrete tokens

### Quantum Perspective
Models meaning as quantum-like phenomena with:
- **Superposition**: Multiple potential meanings simultaneously
- **Measurement**: Interpretation "collapses" the superposition
- **Non-Commutativity**: Order of context operations matters
- **Contextuality**: Non-classical correlations in meaning

## Learning Approach

Each module follows these teaching principles:

1. **Multi-perspective learning**: Concepts are presented from concrete, numeric, and abstract perspectives
2. **Intuition-first**: Physical analogies and visualizations build intuition before formal definitions
3. **Progressive complexity**: Each module builds on previous ones, gradually increasing in sophistication
4. **Practical grounding**: Theoretical concepts are connected to practical implementations
5. **Socratic questioning**: Reflective questions encourage deeper understanding

## Reading Order

For newcomers, we recommend following the numerical order of the modules (01 → 14). However, different paths are possible based on your interests:

### For Prompt Engineers
Atoms → Molecules → Cells → Organs → Prompt Programming → Cognitive Tools

### For Field Theory Enthusiasts
Neural Fields Foundations → Persistence and Resonance → Field Orchestration → Emergence and Attractor Dynamics → Unified Field Theory

### For Symbolic Mechanism Fans
Symbolic Mechanisms → Quantum Semantics → Unified Field Theory

### For Complete Understanding
Follow the full sequence from 1 to 14
