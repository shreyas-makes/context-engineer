# Template-Based Strategies - Structured Prompts for Consistent Results

Template-based prompting creates reusable frameworks that ensure consistent, high-quality results across similar tasks. Instead of recreating prompts from scratch, you fill in structured templates tailored to specific types of work.

## What are Template-Based Strategies?

Templates are pre-built prompt structures with placeholders for variable content. They capture the best practices for specific tasks and make them reusable.

**Without Templates (Inconsistent):**
```
"Write a product announcement"
"Create a press release for our new feature" 
"Help me announce this update"
```
*Each prompt is different, results vary widely*

**With Templates (Consistent):**
```
**Product Announcement Template**

Product: [PRODUCT NAME]
Audience: [TARGET AUDIENCE] 
Key Benefit: [PRIMARY VALUE PROPOSITION]
Supporting Features: [2-3 KEY FEATURES]
Social Proof: [TESTIMONIAL/METRIC]
Call to Action: [SPECIFIC NEXT STEP]

Generate announcement copy that:
- Leads with the key benefit
- Explains why it matters to [AUDIENCE]
- Includes social proof
- Ends with clear call to action
- Maintains [BRAND VOICE] tone
```
*Consistent structure, predictable quality*
