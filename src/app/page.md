## What is Context Engineering?

Context engineering is the practice of systematically designing, implementing, and managing the context provided to AI systems to achieve reliable, predictable, and high-quality outputs. It encompasses:

- **Prompt Design**: Crafting effective prompts that communicate intent clearly
- **Context Management**: Organizing and structuring information for optimal AI comprehension
- **Prompt Orchestration**: Chaining and coordinating multiple prompts for complex workflows
- **Quality Assurance**: Testing, evaluating, and optimizing prompt performance

## Why Prompts as Code?

Modern AI applications require the same engineering rigor as traditional software development:

- **Version Control**: Track changes, collaborate, and maintain prompt history
- **Testing**: Validate prompt behavior with automated test suites
- **Deployment**: Manage prompt releases across different environments
- **Monitoring**: Track performance and iterate based on real-world usage
