# Context Engineering Handbook

A practical guide for developers to get consistent, reliable results from AI tools through systematic prompting.

## What is Context Engineering?

Context engineering is the practice of structuring prompts to communicate clearly with AI systems. It turns unpredictable AI interactions into reliable tools you can depend on.

## Core Concepts

### Prompt Structure
Every effective prompt has these elements:
- **Task**: What you want the AI to do
- **Context**: Background information the AI needs
- **Format**: How you want the output structured
- **Constraints**: What to avoid or include

### Context Management
- Provide relevant background information
- Set clear boundaries for the task
- Give examples when helpful
- Specify the desired output format

### Consistency Techniques
- Use templates for repeated tasks
- Maintain consistent terminology
- Apply the same structure across similar prompts
- Document what works for your use cases

## Documentation Structure

This handbook covers:

1. **Foundations** - Basic principles and concepts
2. **Techniques** - Specific methods for different scenarios
3. **Templates** - Reusable patterns for common tasks
4. **Examples** - Real-world applications
5. **Tools** - How to use context engineering with specific AI tools

## Getting Started

1. Read the foundational concepts
2. Try the basic templates
3. Apply techniques to your specific use case
4. Build your own template library
